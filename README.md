# Deep Reinforcement Learning Course Homeworks

This repository contains all homework assignments from the **Deep Reinforcement Learning course**. The assignments cover a range of topics from foundational to advanced RL, including:

- Value-based methods (e.g., Q-Learning, DQN)  
- Policy gradients and actor-critic methods  
- Model-based reinforcement learning  
- Multi-agent RL  
- Imitation learning and inverse RL  

Each homework includes Python implementations, experiments in various environments, and analyses of the results.

**Instructions and assignment descriptions** are provided on the course website: [https://deeprlcourse.github.io/homeworks/](https://deeprlcourse.github.io/homeworks/)
